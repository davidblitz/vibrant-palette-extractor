[Try it online!](https://davidblitz.github.io/vibrant-color-extractor)

Load an image and get the most prominent colors according to [vibrant.js](https://github.com/jariz/vibrant.js)!

## What Can You Use It For?
Imagine you want to design a website, an animation, etc. but you don't really know which colors you are going to pick. Now, you can just think of an image you like and pick the colors that are most prominent in that image for your website, your animation, etc. !

## How Does It Work?
Well, I'm using `vibrant.js` for the palette extraction which in turn is a port of the `Palette` class of the `android.support` library. I don't know the algorithm behind it, if you do - let me know!
